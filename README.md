# IoP Dinocorn

The WiFi Dinocorn is a part of the IoP (Internet of Plush) network of devices. IoP devices are made to interract with each other and also with users in anamorphized way. The WiFi Dinocorn serves as a wireless repeater, when connected to an outgoing internet connection, and also as a captive portal without outgoing connection to allow people to use its text to speech functions. 

## Text to speech

When one connects to the Dinocorn's speech portal, they are met with a box asking them to enter in what they would like the Dinocorn to say. This text is stripped of all special characters and then fed through a text to speech application to be said aloud. 

## Repeater functions

Dinocorn features a prominent antenna from its head as well as a smaller antenna in its tail. The larger antenna is used to broadcast the hotspot, whilst the smaller antenna is used to connect to an open wireless connection. Mainly the repeater functionality acts as a convenience and as a way to troubleshoot the Dinocorn when something isn't working. 

## Software and Hardware

The Dinocorn consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero (1.3), a Li-Po Shim from Pimeroni, and two wireless adapters. 
The plush shell is made of fleece fabric, felt for details, and thread. 

The captive portal is adapted from the NoDogSplash repository.
